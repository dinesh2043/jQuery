# Google API and Facebook API implementation using jquery and java script

This application is very old application done in JSFiddle in 2012. The main concept of this application was to use facebook API to login
into facebook account. When the user sucessfully login into the facebook account the application looks for the friends who have used 
facebook check-in services and retrives the friends check-in location, latest facebook status and friends events. Than that location latitude
and longitude is used to mark the friends in the map according to the location information. When the mouse is hovered above those markers
the additional information of friends was displayed.

Actually it was working fine when I have developed this application but in 2015 the API features were reviewed and the permission friends_location, 
friends_status and friends_events were depricited and now it is not working properly.
